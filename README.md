# Rules of Mastermind
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

 - A random 4 color master code is generated from 6 different color options
 - You are the Codebreaker - your job is to figure out the master code by creating your own combination of four colors.
 - Based on the colors that you submit, the application will return up to 4 red and/or white pegs.
 - A white peg denotes that you have selected a correct color.
 - A red peg tells you that you have selected a correct color AND placed it in the correct position.
 - Which color and which position these key pegs refer to is up to you to deduce using logic.
 - You have 12 turns to guess the correct combination of colors.
 - Can you break the code?
